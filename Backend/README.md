# Backend
This is where all the code that qualifies as the Backend of the project is housed.

## Technology We Use For Now
- Express 
- Docker
- Firebase FCM

## Micro-services 
We are aiming to make the backend modularized into microservices, which are represented by a Docker container. All the microservices will be "united" in a Docker Compose that exposes and organizes each one of them.

### Microservices Available
- Notification Service
- Authentication Service
- Databse Service (in process)
